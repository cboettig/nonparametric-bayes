@article{Thorson2014,
abstract = {State-space estimation methods are increasingly used in ecology to estimate productivity and abundance of natural populations while accounting for variability in both population dynamics and measurement processes. However, functional forms for population dynamics and density dependence often will not match the true biological process, and this may degrade the performance of state-space methods. We therefore developed a Bayesian semiparametric state-space model, which uses a Gaussian process (GP) to approximate the population growth function. This offers two benefits for population modeling. First, it allows data to update a specified "prior" on the population growth function, while reverting to this prior when data are uninformative. Second, it allows variability in population dynamics to be decomposed into random errors around the population growth function ("process error") and errors due to the mismatch between the specified prior and estimated growth function ("model error"). We used simulation modeling to illustrate the utility of GP methods in state-space population dynamics models. Results confirmed that the GP model performs similarly to a conventional state-space model when either (1) the prior matches the true process or (2) data are relatively uninformative. However, GP methods improve estimates of the population growth function when the function is misspecified. Results also demonstrated that the estimated magnitude of "model error" can be used to distinguish cases of model misspecification. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects for GP methods in other state-space models, including age and length-structured, meta-analytic, and individual-movement models.},

@article{Sugeno2013,
abstract = {The maximum annual reproductive rate (i.e., the slope at the origin in a stock-recruitment relationship) is one of the most important biological reference points in fisheries; it sets the upper limit to sustainable fishing mortality. Estimating the maximum reproductive rate by fitting parametric models to stock-recruitment data may not be a robust approach because two statistically indistinguishable models can generate radically different estimates. To mitigate this issue, we developed a flexible, semiparametric Bayesian approach based on a conditional Gaussian process prior specifically designed to estimate the maximum annual reproductive rate, and applied it to analyze simulated stock-recruitment data sets. Compared with results based on other Gaussian process priors, we found that the conditional Gaussian process prior provided superior results: the accuracy and precision of estimates were enhanced without increasing model complexity. Moreover, compared with parametric alternatives, performance of the conditional Gaussian process prior was comparable to that of the data-generating model and always better than the wrong model.},

		  However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult
		  task, since ecology is known for its complexity.
		  Measurement and/or process errors are often the only
		  sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex
		  ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for
		  uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in
		  parameters governing the specified model, and in initial
		  and boundary conditions. Only then can we be confident in
		  the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an
		  analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework
		  that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given
		  the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical
		  statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is
		  not new in ecology, and there are many examples (both
		  Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating
		  the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide
		  a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which
		  discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology
		  can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion
		  and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie. Our
		  thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a
		  powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the
		  presence of inevitable but quantifiable uncertainties, even
		  if practical issues sometimes require pragmatic

		  outcomes are maximized while overall costs are minimized,

		  widespread recognition of the importance that equitable
		  distribution of benefits or costs across society can play
		  in conservation success, little formal theory exists for
		  how to explicitly incorporate equity into conservation
		  planning and prioritization. Here, we develop that theory
		  and implement it for three very different case studies in

		  wider Coral Triangle region (Southeast Asia). We show that
		  equity tends to trade off nonlinearly with the potential to
		  achieve conservation objectives, such that similar

		  to a point. However, these case studies also produce a
		  range of trade-off typologies between equity and
		  conservation, depending on how one defines and measures
		  social equity, including direct (linear) and no trade-off.
		  Important gaps remain in our understanding, most notably
		  how equity influences probability of conservation success,
		  in turn affecting the actual ability to achieve

		  stcocks, and growing interest in harvesting new kinds of

		  fisheries to take account of interactions among species. In
		  particular, as Antarctic krill-fishing industries grow,
		  there is a need to agree upon sound principles for managing
		  the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Using simple models, we
		  discuss the way multispecies food webs respond to the
		  harvesting of species at differrent trophic levels. These
		  biological and economic insights are applied to a
		  discussion of fisheries in the Southern Otean and the North
		  Sea and to enunciate some for harvesting in multispecies
