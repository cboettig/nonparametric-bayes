This repository contains the research compendium of our work in
nonparametric Bayesian inference for improving ecosystem management under
deep structural uncertainty. The compendium contains all data, code, 
and text associated with the publication and has been permanently archived
at the DOI indicated by the above badge.

## R package ##

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes)

This repository is organized as an R package, providing functions to integrate
the __stochastic dynamic programming__ and __Gaussian process inference__
methods explored here. Nevertheless, this package has been written explicitly
for this project and may not yet be suitable for more general purpose use.

## Manuscript ##

[![Build Status](http://server.carlboettiger.info:88/api/badge/github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes/status.svg?branch=master)](http://server.carlboettiger.info:88/github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes)

The results of this project have now been written up for publication. See
the `manuscript` directory for details, including the code necessary to
run the examples shown.
